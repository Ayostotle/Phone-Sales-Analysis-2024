### Key Insights & Tools Used:

 UPI was the most popular and highest revenue-generating payment method.

Young people showed a strong preference for Apple products.

 Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query.

 A star schema was built to separate fact and dimension tables.

 Interactive slicers were added to filter data by country, month, gender, payment method, and year.

 ### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

First, with India and Turkey contributing the highest revenue and unit sales, future marketing campaigns and inventory allocation should focus heavily on these regions. The notable success of online channels (generating $9M in revenue) suggests prioritizing digital sales strategies over in-store or partner channels. Android devices significantly outperformed iOS, contributing $11M to total revenue—indicating that expanding Android model offerings could yield higher returns.

UPI was the most used and profitable payment method, making it essential to optimize this transaction method across sales platforms. Additionally, the dashboard shows February had the highest monthly revenue—identifying seasonal peaks that can be leveraged for promotions.

Furthermore, the correlation between age demographics and brand preference reveals that younger customers show a strong preference for Apple products, while Samsung appeals more to older groups. This insight can guide targeted marketing strategies based on age segmentation.
